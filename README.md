Code for various programming exercises.

NB: for Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net) in particular, only exercises for which solutions are already publicly available elsewhere online have been included in this repo. For the moment, this is all the exercises I've done, but if I ever start getting to more recent and/or difficult problems, I'll put those in a private repo.
