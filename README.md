Code for various programming exercises.

I do not own copyright over the problem descriptions, by and large. Any
original code I wrote is released under the CC0 1.0 Universal LICENSE.

NB: for Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net) in particular, only exercises
for which solutions are already publicly available elsewhere online have been
included in this repo. For the moment, this is all the exercises I've done, but
if I ever start getting to more recent and/or difficult problems, I'll put
those in a private repo.
